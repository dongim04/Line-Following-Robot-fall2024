# Arduino-Based Line Following Robot with Closed-Loop Motor Control

### Setting Up the Environment

Make sure you have the Adafruit Motor Shield library installed for controlling the motors. If you haven’t done so yet, you can install it via the Arduino IDE:

Go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries.

Search for Adafruit Motor Shield V2 Library and install it.


### Basic Motor Control Setup
Start by initializing the motor shield and the motors. Here's a simple template:
`Basic_Motor_Control_Setup.ino`

This code initializes the motors and makes the robot move forward at half speed. You will add more to this based on sensor input.


### Reading from the IR Sensors
Next, you need to integrate your IR reflectance sensors. If your IR sensors are connected to analog pins, the code below shows how to read values from them.
`Reading_IR_Sensors.ino`

This code reads the values from the IR sensors and prints them to the serial monitor, which helps you calibrate and adjust the threshold for detecting the tape.


### Implementing Basic Line Following Logic
Now, you can implement basic control logic to steer the robot based on the IR sensor readings. For example, if the left sensor detects the line, slow down the right motor and vice versa.

The threshold value determines when the sensor detects the black tape versus the floor. You’ll need to calibrate this by observing the sensor values on the serial monitor.
`Basic_Line_Following.ino`

### Tuning via Serial Communication
If you want to adjust the robot's behavior without re-uploading code, you can use Serial commands to adjust motor speed or other parameters in real-time.

Here's an example that allows you to change the speed of the motors via the serial monitor:
`Control_Serial_Connection.ino`
